# ZScript Quake Movement

This script modifies GZDoom's movement code (which is conveniently written in ZScript, now) to more closely resemble Quake. This means slower, less slippery movement (similar to [Nash's mod](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=105&t=35761)) and strafejumping (which can be turned on/off with a CVar), among other things.

Features:

* Slower, less slippery, movement
* Strafejumping
* CVars to enable/disable straferunning and strafejumping
* Speedometer
* Strafejumping bot (requires `sv_cheats 1`, of course)
