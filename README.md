# ZScript Quake Movement

This script modifies GZDoom's movement code (which is conveniently written in ZScript, now) to more closely resemble Quake. This means slower, less slippery movement (similar to [Nash's mod](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=105&t=35761)) and strafejumping (which can be turned on/off with a CVar), among other things.
